Technical problems
-------------------
While installing the Apache Derby database on windows,<br>
I found that setting the environment variables(EV) via the command line would not work,<br>
as the changes were reverted after closing the command line.<br>
To make the changes "stick", I had to manually update the EVs from windows properties (the system GUI).
