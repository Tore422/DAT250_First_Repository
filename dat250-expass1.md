Installed software
-------------------

Intellij Ultimate edition, version 2020.02<br>
Apache Maven, version 3.6.3<br>
Java Development Kit (JDK) version 14.0.2<br>
Git bash, version 2.28.0<br>

Installation progress report
-----------------------------

I already had the Git bash client installed, so I updated it by<br>
running the command: git update-git-for-windows<br>
and verified by checking that the version was correct using the command: git version

I had an earlier version of Intellij already installed,<br>
but since a new version had been released I had to download and follow the installation process anew from the jetbrains web site.

I did not have Maven installed, so I downloaded and followed the instructions on https://maven.apache.org/install.html

I had a few JDKs already installed, but decided to install the latest version (14.0.2) in order to be up to date for this course.
